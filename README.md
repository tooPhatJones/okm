How to write a good tutorial





# ephiphyte
"Epiphyte" someimtes called an "air tree" is a botany word used to mean a plant that grows on a plant. 
A phorophyte is the name for the plant the epiphyte grows on. 
Used here, an epiphyte is a relative recomended entry point into the tree of all knowledge, that does not start at the root.  
Or in other words a contextless entry point to the tree of knowledge made possible with pattern recognition. 
For example, learning to drive a car. 
In a traditional tutorial, you would learn math and chemistry, engineering, and automotive science and then finally after knowing how a car works, learn to drive a car.
Learning to drive as an epiphyte would start with learning to drive and the rest could follow if desired. 

Epiphytes are efficient relative to the learners goals when building the foundation takes more effort than starting without context in the middle of the tree.
Epiphytes have no prerequisites, instead they teach the prerequisites as they go.
If the distance to the root is further, then an epiphyte is recommended. 


# Traditional tutorial
A tutorial that starts at the root/roots of knowledge and grows up. 
A traditional tutorial has no prerequisites because it starts all the way at the bottom.
A traditional tutorial is always less efficient to the learners needs than an epiphyte.
Traditional tutorials should be avoided. 
However being able to outline a traditional tutorial can be a powerful tool for communicating a skills location in the graph of knowledge



# make as few assumptions about your audience as possible, 
use the simplest language possible at all times 
define all reasonably new language as you use it 
Disambiguation, ie if any words or phrasing can be used in any other context, stop and specify the context you mean.

  
# tutorial planning 
first check the graph to see if you can piggy back on anyone elses work.
Make list of all new nodes
Mark out compound concepts
start to create content keeping in mind good practice guidelines



# Illustrative design: 
Simply put, don't explain where you can illustrate. However usually for any broad context switch an explanation will be necessary to bridge the gap between contexts.
Explanations can be built into the material. Or if they are needed to transition context for the sake of a specific tutorial, then they can be separate modules
The rule is to use explanation as sparingly as possible and allow your illustrations to do the majority of communication where possible. 
Illustrate with illustrations that demonstrate with source matter representation

# Source matter presentation
This means that your tutorial should be created in the medium you are trying to teach as much as possible.
If teaching js, don't make a website with snipets of js, or use a codepen, or a video. 
Put your tutorial direly in the environment the learner will be using. 
Put it in a JavaScript file, in an executable environment. 

They should be able to learn without the environment through illustration, but if they are in the environment, they should be able to demonstrate? 


# Low coupling high cohesion and Unix philosophy
the following terms are used to describe best practices for creating modules (swappable pieces of something) 
Low coupling means don't create unnecessary dependencies for your modules.
High cohesion means group modules together that go together
Unix philosophy states that your modules should do one thing and do it well. 

These three design practices foster creations that are easier to update, add onto, and refactor when necessary.

Make your illustrations demonstrations that can be individually executed separately before being combined. 





# The pub system 
overview of git...
Advantages of open source, why its basically required
root.json metadata rules, 
how to describe the tutorial tree   
the reputation system and best practices for use
when to white list, when to blacklist ect
how to do tutorial versions with the pub system


Nodes being defined by line numbers unless they are in binaries

Creating tutorials in binaries, video, blender files ect..
